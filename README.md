# Introduction to Git Workshop (Hacktoberfest-2020 @ Ashoka) üíªüíú

Hello World! 
The Development Wing of the Computer Science Society at Ashoka University and WireByte the Makers' Club would like to warmly welcome you to our Hacktoberfest 2020 @ Ashoka meetup!
In this introductory workshop you will learn about:
* Version Control Systems
* Git
* Create your GitHub account 
* Repositories, commits, forks, branches and pull requests
* And how to contribute to Open Source Code!

The interactive workshop has 3 checkpoints:
Checkpoint 1 - Creating your GitHub account and confirming whether you have Git installed on your machine 
Checkpoint 2 - Creating a repository, cloning a local copy of it onto your system, making some changes and pushing it back to your remote repository all from your CLI
Checkpoint 3 - Forking this very repository and submitting a pull request

Once you've passed all 3 checkpoints give yourself a pat on the back you've successfully completed our workshop and can start contributing to Open Source Code! üéâüéâüéâ
